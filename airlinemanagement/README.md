# Airline Management System API

This project is a backend system for managing airplanes, flights, and reservations in an airline. The API allows users to manage airplane details, flight schedules and make reservations.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Django** - A high-level Python web framework
- **Django Rest Framework** - Toolkit for building Web APIs
- **SQLite** - A lightweight database used for development
- **Postman** - For testing the API endpoints

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airline-management-system.git
   cd airline-management-system

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

        python -m venv venv
  
      For Windows:

        venv\Scripts\activate

      For Mac/Linux:

        source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install dependencies:**

        pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Apply migrations:**

       python manage.py migrate

5. **Run the development server:**

       python manage.py runserver

6. **Visit the API:**

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/airplanes
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/flights
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/reservations
        

## Features

This Airline Management System includes several essential and optional features to enhance the functionality of the API.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Conflict Check
- Ensures that the same airplane cannot have overlapping flight times.  
- There must be at least a **1-hour difference** between two flights of the same aircraft.  
- This validation prevents scheduling conflicts and maintains realistic flight schedules.

### üìä Occupancy Check
- Verifies flight capacity before creating a reservation.  
- If the number of reservations reaches the airplane‚Äôs capacity, the API returns a validation error:  
  **"This flight is fully booked. No more seats available."**

### üîë Reservation Code Generation
- Automatically generates a unique reservation code during reservation creation.  
- The code is at least **5 characters long**, alphanumeric, and ensures each reservation has a distinct identifier.

### üõ´ Flight Filtering
- Allows filtering flights based on various parameters:  
  - **Departure Location**  
  - **Arrival Location**  
  - **Departure Date**  
  - **Arrival Date**
            
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/flights/?arrival_time=2025-03-16&destination=Izmir&departure=Ankara&departure_time=2025-03-16  

- This feature makes it easier to search for specific flights based on passenger preferences.

By combining these features, the system ensures accurate scheduling, prevents overbooking, and enhances usability through automatic reservation codes and optional email notifications. üöÄ


##  API Endpoints

**Airplanes:**

        GET /airplanes/ - Get all airplanes
        GET /airplanes/{id}/ - Get airplane details by ID
        POST /airplanes/ - Create a new airplane
        PUT /airplanes/{id}/ - Update an existing airplane
        DELETE /airplanes/{id}/ - Delete an airplane

**Flights:**

        GET /flights/ - Get all flights
        GET /flights/{id}/ - Get flight details by ID
        POST /flights/ - Create a new flight
        PUT /flights/{id}/ - Update an existing flight
        DELETE /flights/{id}/ - Delete a flight

**Reservations:**

        GET /reservations/ - Get all reservations
        GET /reservations/{id}/ - Get reservation details by ID
        POST /reservations/ - Create a new reservation
        DELETE /reservations/{id}/ - Delete a reservation


## Validation

The API includes basic validation:


- **Flight Capacity Check:** When creating a reservation, the system checks if the flight is fully booked. If the number of reservations exceeds the airplane's capacity, a validation error is raised.  
- **Passenger Name Validation:** Passenger names must be at least 5 characters long. Otherwise, a validation error is raised.  
- **Tail Number Format Validation:** Airplane tail numbers must follow the format `AB-C5D`, where:  
  - `A` and `B` are uppercase letters.  
  - `C5D` consists of uppercase letters or digits.  
  If the tail number does not match this pattern, a validation error is raised.  
- **Flight Conflict Check:** An airplane cannot have two flights scheduled within 1 hour of each other. The system checks the departure and arrival times to prevent scheduling conflicts.  



## Testing with Postman
    
The API can be tested using Postman. Below are the steps to test the API:

**Import Postman Collection:**

Download the Postman collection file (airline_management_system.postman_collection.json). Open Postman and click Import.
Select the downloaded collection file to import.

**Set Up Environment Variables:**

In Postman, go to Manage Environments and create a new environment.

Add the following variables:

base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/id: This will be dynamically replaced in the URL (for GET/PUT requests).
      
## Test Endpoints:

Use the collection to test the available endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Replace the {{id}} variable in the URL with an actual ID value for requests that require it.


## Postman Collection
        
The Postman collection is included to test all the API endpoints. You can find the collection file in the project root directory. Import the collection into Postman and use the environment settings to dynamically replace variables in the URLs.

## Requirements
The project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using the following command:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
